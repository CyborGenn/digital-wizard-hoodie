=====================

This is code for a project in Arduino using 30 LEDs sewn into the sleeves and hood of a hooded sweater. The lights cycle through different patterns depending on the position of an accelerometer sewn into the sleeve. This project was initially made for a project at Georgian College in the Computer Programmer Analyst program, and will be featured in an art installation in Barrie, Ontario titled "Art Ce Soir" as part of an exhibit by the members of SimCoLab, Barrie's first hackerspace.
